Anything On Rails
==========

I like the various rails plugins on emacs, but for what I want they
are too heavy.

I use [Anything](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Anything) in Emacs a
lot, and for things like quick navigation I think it is all I need.

So here is a very lightweight Anything Source that shows all the major
files in a rails project, so navigation is pretty easy.

I also added [RubyKitchs](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/rubikitch)
anything Rake source so you can run rake tasks pretty easily too.

I'll be adding stuff to this as needed, but I want to keep it small,
and not compete with Rinari or rails-mode-reloaded.
